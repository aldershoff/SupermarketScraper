SupermarketScraper
==================

Python project for scraping Dutch supermarkets

Since big data and data gathering are words you hear quite often, I started looking into gathering data that I thought was interesting.

This is still a work in progress.

## TODO
- [ ] Make main file to run the scraper and scrape all supermarkets
- [ ] Define better project structure
- [ ] Make the supermarkets into "modules"
- [ ] Build tests to see if all scraping still works
- [ ] Add database support and define a model to store all data in

## OPTIONAL
- [ ] Add web interface to view all results
